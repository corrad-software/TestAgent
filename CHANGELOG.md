All notable changes to TestAgent are documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Playwright Codegen recorder** — Record button in scenario detail modal launches `npx playwright codegen`, auto-saves generated spec to DB
- **Custom spec support** — scenarios can store recorded Playwright code alongside templates; toggle between "Template" and "Recorded" when running
- **Code viewer** — collapsible view of recorded spec with line count and delete option
- **Dashboard page** with recharts — pass rate trend (30 days), runs per day bar chart, module breakdown, stat cards, recent runs table
- **Search & filter** in Library — search by name/Kes ID/Scenario ID, filter by status (passed/failed/never run), filter by flow (positif/negatif), result count
- **Daily stats API** — `GET /library/daily-stats` and `GET /library/projects/:id/daily-stats` for time-series data
- **Tech Stack page** — visual documentation of all technologies used
- **API Explorer page** — interactive API docs with 34 endpoints, try-it button, copy cURL
- **Unit & integration test suite** (59 tests) using Vitest
  - `specGenerator` — template generation, auth injection, URL escaping
  - `auth` — password hashing, JWT sign/verify, middleware (requireAuth, requireAdmin)
  - `testRunner` — Playwright result summary parser
  - `dssbParser` — Excel format detection, project/credential/test case extraction
  - `scenarioLibrary` — database CRUD, JSON round-trips, cascade deletes, run history
- npm scripts: `test`, `test:unit`, `test:integration`, `test:coverage`

### Changed
- Extracted DSSB parser from `server.ts` into `src/dssbParser.ts` for testability
- Exported `buildSummary` from `testRunner.ts` for unit testing
- Fixed auth injection regex in `specGenerator.ts` (was not matching template describe blocks)

- **Pre-flight login check** — tests login credentials before running Playwright tests, with clear pass/fail feedback

- **Kes ID / Scenario ID fields** — on scenarios and list view columns
- Login auth screenshots (`auth-01-login-page.png`, `auth-02-credentials-filled.png`, `auth-03-logged-in.png`)
